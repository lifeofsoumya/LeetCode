vector<int> addToArrayForm(vector<int> A, int K) {
// Traverse the digits of A from right to left, starting from the rightmost digit
// Continue until the first digit or until K becomes zero
for (int i = A.size() - 1; i >= 0 && K > 0; --i) {
// Add the value of K to the current digit of A
A[i] += K;
// Compute the quotient of the current digit of A divided by 10
// Assign this value to K, as it represents the carry-over digit that needs to be added to the next digit of A
K = A[i] / 10;
// Compute the remainder of the current digit of A divided by 10
// Assign this value to the current digit of A, as it represents the new value of the current digit of A after the addition of K
A[i] %= 10;
}
// If there are any carry-over digits left in K, add them to the beginning of A using the insert() method
while (K > 0) {
// Insert the last digit of K at the beginning of the vector A using the insert() method
A.insert(A.begin(), K % 10);
// Divide K by 10 to remove the last digit that was just added to A
K /= 10;
}
// Return the modified vector A, which now represents the array-form of the sum of the original integer A and the integer K
return A;
}
I hope that helps!
